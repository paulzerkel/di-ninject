# Dependency Injection with Ninject
This is a simple lunch presentation to demonstrate some common scenarios of using dependency injection with Ninject.

## Caution!
This presentation is probably out of date but may still be useful for basic examples.

## Overview
The presentation is built with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) and hosted on GitHub Pages: http://paulzerkel.github.io/pres-di-ninject/

Edit the root `index.html` file to change the presentation. All of the files for Reveal.js are in `/reveal`. The master branch contains the live site.

## Examples
There are a few basic examples located in `src`.

### Exercise 1
Tightly coupled code, no IoC used.

### Exercise 2
Added in manual dependency injection.

### Exercise 3
Replaced the manual injection with Ninject.

### Exercise 4
Demonstrates how Ninject will resolve dependency chains.

### Exercise 5
Shows an implementation of the decorator pattern.
